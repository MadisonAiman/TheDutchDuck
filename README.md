**Technologies**

HTML: For structuring the web page and content.

CSS: For styling the carousel and making it visually appealing.

JavaScript: For adding interactivity, including automatic image rotation and swipe functionality for mobile devices.

**Features**

Responsive Design: 

The carousel adapts to various screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
Automatic 

Image Rotation: 

The images in the carousel automatically rotate every three seconds, keeping the content dynamic and engaging.

Mobile Swipe Functionality: 

Users can swipe left or right to navigate through images on mobile devices, enhancing accessibility and user interaction.

Smooth Transitions: 

The use of opacity for fading effects during image transitions provides a visually appealing experience for users.

Dynamic Image Loading: 

The option to load images dynamically from an array allows for easy updates and scalability, making it simple to add or remove images as needed.

The carousel's JavaScript implementation is a standout feature. It combines automatic rotation with swipe functionality, allowing for a user-friendly experience. The use of event listeners for touch events ensures that users on mobile devices can navigate the images intuitively. The automatic rotation is complemented by smooth fading transitions, which enhance the overall aesthetics of the carousel.

**Future Enhancements/ Optimizations:**
If given more time, I would improve the carousel further:

Expanded Image Library:

Integrating more images into the carousel would provide a richer experience and a more comprehensive showcase of the menu or product offerings.

Additional Features: 

Features such as manual navigation buttons (next/previous), image captions, or even user-controlled speed for image rotation might enhance usability.

Implementing lazy loading for images would improve performance, especially for users on slower connections.
